        	Hello to anyone that may be wondering where I went.<br /><br />Due to a minor baseless conflict considering the basis of being in a public Discord server VC, I have recieved a single death threat containing my full legal name, date of birth, occupation, place of occupation, my address, and a list of my current living family members that are contained in my current household.<br /><br />Considering this issue, I have ultimately decided to lock down everything and exit the 5-fret community as a whole alongside abandoning any active projects for 5-fret or anything behind my username for fear of my safety.<br /><br />This includes any bots I am currently running for any server (which will stay active until this website shuts down), and any projects I was actively working on at the time before this incident and now.<br /><br />It burdens me heavily that it has come to this conclusion but life must go on.<br /><br />To the person that sent me the threat, please do not hurt me or any of my family, I am merely one entity on the vast internet and do not wish anyone any harm.<br /><br />- MetricCepheid
